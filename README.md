# Sketch

### An online sketch-board that allows for a variety of functionality including opening a grid, scaling,  lightening & darkening, etc.

What I learned:

* How to use a grid instead of a flexbox
* More indepth knowledge into eventListeners
* Changing HTML & CSS using JavaScript
* How to layout JavaScript

Bugs-to-Fix / Features to Add:

* Lightening and darkening can only be changed back using lightening & darkening
* Zooming out messes with the page layout
* If the grid is still on while scaling the button will appear on
* Add a dropper to grab a color from the board
